# Sanity

A general purpose programming language for the purpose of evaluating some
random ideas I had about ways to improve existing languages.

Every programming language has its faults and as generations of languages progress
they slowly improve. Throughout my work I've come across a few things I think
could be done better. This language serves the purpose of trying out many of these
ideas to discover their practicality and usefullness. Most are probably trash, but
maybe one or two will prove to be an improvement on modern programming paradigms.
If anything works out particularly well, maybe it could be included in the next
big programming language!

## Overview

Sanity is a compiled strongly-typed language somewhere between object-oriented and
functional. Current plans are to compile it to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and
execute it on that platform. This would allow it to be run on just about any
machine without requiring me to generate assembly for every assembler on the
market.

## Feature List

This is the list of random features I'd like to try out. TODO: Elaborate and add.

### Simplified Constructors

### Proxies

### First Class Mixins

### Variables Read-Only by Default

### Context

### Compile-Time Execution

### Elm-style Streams

### Testing Support
